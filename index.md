# Synchronous collaborative programming 

## Project for CSCI 4800/6800 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

### Collaborators:
1. Ehsan Latif (ehsan.latif@uga.edu)
2. Afsaneh Shams (as14847@uga.edu)
3. Jerel Harris (jkh11360@uga.edu)
4. Peter Lim (ml84114@uga.edu)

### Problem of Study
Live coding for the sake of cooperative learning without proper collaboration can lead to code cramming without understanding. Collaborative writing without history and log maintenance can cause a lack of transparency and poor engagement of collaborators.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ehsanlatif/CSCI-4800-6800-HCI-Term-Project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
